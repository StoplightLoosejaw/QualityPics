# QualityPics
https://qualitypics.herokuapp.com/
Small django project that shows you pics from database. It consists of api and basic homepage 
Database consists of one table which contains pic urls with a small description.
So first I made a small api for working with it using Django Rest Framework,
then I decided that I want to visualise somehow results of its work. So there is now a homepage that allows user to see results of retrieve and random retrieve method.

<br>
                                id/{{somenumber}} - retrieves JSON with data about pic with that id <br>
                                randompic - retrieves JSON with data about random pic <br>
